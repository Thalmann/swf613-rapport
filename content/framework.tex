\section{Common Game Framework}
The cars project has been built on an existing framework as mentioned shortly in \cref{s1_redesign}. 
This made the creation of the game easier because the basic problems of game development on the android platform was already taken care of.
It was therefore relatively painless to get to the actual design of the game. 

Some project proposals at the beginning of the semester suggested making more games for the citizens.
It is therefore ideal to create a separate project that contains the framework so others can use it in future projects.
Our modified version of the framework has been moved to a new repository for this to be possible.
This repository can be a base for the development of future games in the giraf project.

In this chapter the usage of the framework will be described in order to make it easier for the students from next semester to create games in it.

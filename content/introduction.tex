Throughout the entire course of this multi-project, the project-group worked on a project called Stemmespillet (formerly Cars).

The overall structure and purpose of the project is explained in \cref{multiproject}, along with the project's place in multi-project.

The multi-project was divided into 4 sprints, each with its own process and result.
The result of each sprint is documented by a chapter (see chapters \ref{sprint1}-\ref{sprint4}).

As another result of the project, two chapters were formed, to be used by next year's multi-project semester.
The first chapter contains a description of a generic Android Game Framework, which could be the foundation for new games.
The second chapter contains a guide to the way version control, by the use of Git, was handled during the semester.

As a conclusion of the report, some general advice will be given, to be used by next year's multi-project.

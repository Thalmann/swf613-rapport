Throughout the entire course of this multi-project, the project-group worked on a project called The Voice Game (formerly Cars).

The overall structure and purpose of the project is explained in \cref{multiproject}, along with this project's place in multi-project.

The course was divided into 4 sprints, each with its own process and result.
The result of each sprint is documented in its own chapter (see chapters \ref{sprint1}-\ref{sprint4}).

As another result of the project, two chapters were formed, documenting our collaboration with the other groups in the multi project.

The first chapter contains a description of a generic Android Game Framework, which could be the foundation for new games.
The second chapter contains a guide to the way version control was handled during the semester.

Each sprint is concluded by evaluation and future works chapters that assess the result of the sprint and recommend areas of the project to work on in a future sprint.
Finally, some general advice will be given, to be used by next year's multi-project.

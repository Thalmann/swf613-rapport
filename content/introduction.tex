Throughout the entire course of this project, the project-group worked on a sub-project called Stemmespillet (formerly Cars).

The course was divided into 4 sprints, each with their own process and result.
The result of each sprint is documented by a chapter each (see chapters \ref{sprint1}-\ref{sprint4}).

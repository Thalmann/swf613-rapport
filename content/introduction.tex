Throughout the entire course of this multi-project, the project-group worked on a project called Stemmespillet (formerly Cars).

The overall structure and purpose of the project is explained in \cref{multiproject}, along with this project's place in multi-project.

The course was divided into 4 sprints, each with their own process and result.
The result of each sprint is documented by a chapter each (see chapters \ref{sprint1}-\ref{sprint4}).

As another result of the project, two chapters were formed, with the lone result to be used by next year's multi-project semester.
The first chapter contains a guide to the way version control, by the use of Git, was handled during the semester.
The second chapter contains a description of a generic Android Game Framework, which could be the foundation for new games.

The project is concluded by evaluation and future works chapters.
Finally, some general advice will be given, to be used by next year's multi-project.

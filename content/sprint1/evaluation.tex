\paragraph{Requirement 1}\label{sprint1:req1}
Looking at \cref{product-sprint1} the game starts at the left side of the screen and ends at the right side of the screen, without any scrolling.
\paragraph{Requirement 2}\label{sprint1:req2}
It is possible to control the car with volume, making the car move up when the input volume is high and down when it is low.
The car stays at its position when there is no input.
For more detail can be found at \cref{sprint1:product}.
\paragraph{Requirement 4}\label{sprint1:req4}
Looking at \cref{product-sprint1} on the right side there are three boxes labelled 'garage', these represent the place where the graphics for the garages should be.
How they work is explained in \cref{sprint1:product}.

\subsection{Graphic}
For the graphics in 'Cars' the authors have chosen to use OpenGL \cite{opengl}.
OpenGL is a tool for advanced graphics and it can be used for 3d graphics.
For a simple game like 'Cars' it is simply overkill.
As mentioned in the developer guide for Android \cite{android_opengl}, OpenGL should be used for advanced 3d graphics and if you need calculation power from the GPU.
Instead the guide suggest that the standard tools in the framework would be sufficient.

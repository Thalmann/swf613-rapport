It seems that the authors of the code are not familiar with the OOP term inheritance.
Inheritance in OOP is when you have a class based on an other class.
This is useful for code reuse.

An example of good use of inheritance is if we have a class called \textit{Vehicle}.
Which e.g. has a method \textit{ChangeOwner} and a field \textit{RegistrationNumber}.
We can then make a specialisation of \textit{Vehicle} e.g. called \textit{Car} and \textit{Truck}.
These two new classes can now also use the method and field there is in \textit{Vehicle}.
This means the code gets reused, instead of having it in both \textit{Car} and \textit{Truck} we have it only in \textit{Vehicle}.

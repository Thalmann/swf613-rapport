In this sprint we focus on the 'Cars' project from the previous multi-project.
The main purpose of the sprint was to get an understanding of the project, while making it usable by both eliminating bugs/errors and implementing missing features.

\paragraph{Cars} is a small game, in which the user controls a car, automatically moving from left to right on a three-lane road.
The user must use voice input, based on pitch, to move the car up and down in order to dodge obstacles on the road and in the end manoeuvre the car into a garage.

\paragraph{Sound input} is an important element of 'Cars', as it is used to control the car.
It is also a part of the game which as of now does not work properly.
Using voice input based on pitch was an original requirement worked out between the Cars group and the stakeholders, since it was worked out to solve a particular problem concerning some autists, not being able to control their pitch during speech.

Based on its importance and that it does not work, this is a major focus point during the first sprint.

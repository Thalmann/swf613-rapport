This section will contain the general problems with the methods in the project 'Cars'.
The section is divided into two subsections; method size and method usability.
\subsection{Method Size}
Method size is a very discussed topic in software development, \textit{Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship by Robert Martin} is a book about code standards.
The following, about method size, is from the book:
\begin{center}
\textit{'The first rule of functions is that they should be small. The second rule of functions is that they should be smaller than that. Functions should not be 100 lines long. Functions should hardly ever be 20 lines long.'}
\end{center}

A problem throughout the code is that basic object oriented principles are not used or are not used properly. 
Classes do not have a clearly defined responsibility, and functionality is instead spread out on several classes. 
This breaks the concept of keeping low cohesion in object oriented design. 
Cohesion is a measure of how the responsibilities of a module are related. 
If the responsibilities are highly related, the module is said to have high cohesion.
An advantage of high cohesion is that it improves maintainability of the system, because changes in one module requires fewer changes in other modules. \stefan{source p√• cohesion (OOAD)?}

Another concept the existing code broke is coupling.
Coupling is the concept of keeping the number of dependencies between modules as low as possible, known as having low coupling.

The fact that the existing code had very high coupling proved it very difficult to change their implementation of control by pitch to control by volume.\stefan{evt. reference to FFT analysis chapter}
Small changes in the existing modules requires extensive refactoring thr\-oughout the system 
\stefan{example?}

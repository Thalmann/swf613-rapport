\section{Design Evaluation}
The original goal of the first sprint was to refactor the Cars project. 
After using a few weeks reading and changing the code it turned out to be more complicated than initially assumed.
The changes we made was small but required extensive work because of the lack of structure in the project.
It was decided that a total redesign of the application would be the better option.
Instead of spending a lot of time trying to understand and modify the code, a redesign would not only take shorter time but would also result in a better design.

The following sections will summarize the problems that made the task of refactoring the cars project near impossible.

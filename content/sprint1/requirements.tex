\section{Requirements}
\label{sprint1:requirements}

The first step in continuing on the project, was to collect the requirements from the report written by \citet*{oldcars}.
These requirements can be seen in \cref{sprint1:requirement_table_1}.
Some of the requirements were vaguely stated in the original report.
The elaboration of the requirements will be considered a priority when preparing interviews with the stakeholder.

To keep track of requirements, we have chosen to use a table with the requirements expressed as user stories as well as if the requirement has been fulfilled and where this is described in the report.
This makes it easier to manage the requirements when they change or get specified in details when communicating with the stakeholders.

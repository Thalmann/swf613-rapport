The first step in continuing on the project from last year was to collect the requirements that the old project group had used.
The following requirements are extracted from the report written by the old project group \citet*{oldcars}:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The game must not be a sidescrolling game, because the citizen must be able to see the goal
\item The game must make it possible for the citizen to control a car
\item The game should contain stars as points
\label{sprint1:requirements:points}

\item When the game is won an reward should be given
\item It must be possible to save and load settings for a specific profile
\item It must be possible to calibrate the microphone 
\item It must be possible for the user to change the difficulty of the game

\subsection{Solution}
\subsubsection{Change from Frequency to Volume}
Because of the problems obtaining the right frequency, explained in \cref{obtaining_frequency}, the idea was to change the control of the car to volume.
The idea was proposed to one of the stakeholders \textit{Tove SÃ¸by} (the speech therapist) so that there would not be worked on a solution which would not be used anyway.
The idea was accepted, see \cref{email_volume} for email correspondence.

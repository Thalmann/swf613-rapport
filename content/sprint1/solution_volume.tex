\subsubsection{Volume}
Because of the problems obtaining the right frequency, explained in \cref{obtaining_frequency}, the idea was to change the control of the car to volume.
The idea was proposed to one of the contactpersons \textit{Tove SÃ¸by} and was accepted, see \cref{email_volume} for email correspondence.

\section{Future Works}
This section contain the assignments which should be considered looking at in the next sprint.

In the next sprint the focus should be on looking at the rest of the requirements, but especially improve and finish the settings and the control of the car.

\subsection{Settings}
The main topic which has to be improved are the settings.
The layout, \cref{sprint2:settings:fig}, has to be modified so that it is clear which settings group together and what it is the user is able to change.
The three colours chosen for the garage should also be changed so the user is able to pick an arbitrary colour.
The microphone calibration setting also has to get changed to some more suitable layout.

\subsection{Control of the car}\label{sprint2:eval:control_car}
The control of the car does still not function proper with the calibration in the settings.
It seems that when the car was calibrated it does not work proper in the game.
But with the hard coded values for the microphone the game works quite okay, so it seems like the calibration in the settings has to be looked at again.

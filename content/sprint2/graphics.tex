\subsection{Graphics}
According to \cref{sprint2:tab1:req13} in \cref{sprint2:requirement_table_1}, the graphics must be kept simple.
To accommodate this both the background and the objects have been kept simple and two dimensional.
The graphics used in the game can be seen on \cref{pausedstate}.
The background consists of a road which is a grey texture, and there is a border of grass in the top and the bottom of the screen, consisting of a green texture.

The objects are chosen so they are simple and yet recognizable.

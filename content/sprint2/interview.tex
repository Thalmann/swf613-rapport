An interview was carried out Wednesday 04-03-2014 with two pedagogues from Birken; Mette Als Andreasen og Kristine Niss Henriksen.

\subsection{Purpose}
At the start of the sprint we were still solely working out from the requirements found in last year's Cars project report.
However, we found that some of these requirements were still not clear, most importantly the overall purpose of the Cars app.
Additionally there were some requirements revolving around customizable speed and difficulty, both being very unspecific.

The goal of the interview was then to establish the overall purpose of the Cars app; how it would be used in practice and how it would relate to real-life problems.
Additionally we would like to figure out how to adjust difficulty in order to make the game more usable, and not be too easy or difficult for some.

\subsection{Planning}
Prior to the interview we discussed and agreed upon topics we would like discussed with the stakeholders.
We decided to stick to topics, and not specific questions, to allow a more open discussion.
This was because we didn't want to lock ourselves too much to the old requirements, in case there were some bigger and better changes available.

There were two main topics; overall purpose and use of the app, and how to customize difficulty.
For the difficulty part we would like to discuss variables like speed and size of the car, number and size of obstacles, and number of garages.
Additionally there was mentioned points and the possibility of competing in the old requirements, we would also like these clarified, as it was not implemented by the previous Car project group.

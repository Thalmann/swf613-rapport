In the previous sprint, a new framework suggested for the 'Cars' app and the implementation of it was begun.
The main focus of this sprint is to continue this implementation, while getting some feedback from the stakeholders, to solve uncertainties regarding the old requirements.

The first part of this sprint chapter contains an interview with the stakeholders, from which new requirements were obtained.
The result is a new list of requirements, based on both the old requirements and the newly obtained.

Following the interview, the design and implementation of the new requirements can be seen.
This is done in an informal manner, explaining the overall idea, and results where appropriate.

The result of the sprint is a working application, which implements most of the requirements.
However, not all of them were fully implemented, and some not at all.

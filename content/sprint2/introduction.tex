In the previous sprint, a new framework was suggested for the 'Cars' app and the implementation of it was begun.
The main focus of this sprint was then to continue this implementation, while trying to get some feedback from the stakeholders, as there still were some uncertainties regarding the old requirements.

The first part of this sprint chapter contains an interview with the stakeholders, from which new requirements were obtained.
Besides remaking the game with the new framework, still based on the old requirements, these new requirements were handled as well.
The result of this is a new list of requirements, based on both the old requirements and the newly obtained.

Following the interview, the design and implementation of the new requirements can be seen.
This is done in an informal manner, explaining the overall idea, and results where appropriate.

The result of the sprint was a workable app, which implemented most of the requirements.
However, as can be seen in the conclusion and future works sections, not all were fully implemented, and some not at all.

\subsection{Screen overlays}
At certain stages of the game, we need to display overlays, containing important information and/or buttons for navigation.

The game screen contains the following overlays:

\begin{itemize}
\item Starting,
\item Paused,
\item Crashed, and
\item Won.
\end{itemize}

All of the screens can be seen in \cref{sprint2:overlays:fig}.

\paragraph{Starting Overlay} is displayed when a new game is started (from either the main menu or the Win Overlay).
It is a short countdown, enabling the player to get ready, as opposed to starting the game straight away, or simply waiting without any feedback for the player.
It is a 3 second countdown (3.. 2.. 1.. Go), as can be seen in \cref{sprint2:overlays:fig:starting}.

\paragraph{Paused overlay} is linked to requirement 9, which states: \textit{It should be possible to pause the game. When the game is paused, a loudness-barometer is displayed next to the car, further visualizing the current loudness.}
At all times when in the game screen, a pause button is visible in the top left corner.
When pressed, the game is paused (the car stops moving) and the loudness gauge is displayed (see \cref{sprint2:overlays:fig:paused}).

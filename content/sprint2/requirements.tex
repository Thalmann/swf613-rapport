\section{Requirements}\label{s2requirements}
Initially the requirements were the same as last sprint.
However, due to the interview carried out during the sprint, some new requirements were gathered, along with some of the old requirements being changed.

Here will be represented a new and complete list of requirements, as a merge between the initial requirements and the newly obtained.

\textbf{Note:} The following is based on \cref{sprint1:requirement_table_1}.
\Cref{sprint1:tab1:req2}  was vague so it was altered to \cref{sprint2:tab1:req2} on \cref{sprint2:requirement_table_1} so it now is more precise.
This also means that the old solution from sprint 1 has to be changed, so this requirement is now unsolved.
\Cref{sprint1:tab1:req3} was completely removed, as the focus should be on using the voice, not winning as such.
\Cref{sprint1:tab1:req8} was vague so it was split into several new requirements regarding difficulty from the interview.

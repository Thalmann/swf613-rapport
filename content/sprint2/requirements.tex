Initially the requirements were the same as last sprint.
However, due to the interview carried out during the sprint, some new requirements were gathered, along with some of the old requirements being changed.

Here will be represented a new and complete list of requirements, as a merge between the initial requirements and the newly obtained.

\textbf{Note:} The 3. requirement on \cref{sprint1:requirement_table_1} was completely removed, as the focus should be on using the voice, not winning as such.
The 2. requirement on \cref{sprint1:requirement_table_1} was vague so it was altered to the 2. requirement on \cref{sprint2:requirement_table_1} so it now is more precise.
The 8. requirement on \cref{sprint1:requirement_table_1} was vague so it was split into several new requirements regarding difficulty from the interview.

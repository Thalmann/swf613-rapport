Based on the interview described in the previous section, we have obtained the following requirements.

\begin{itemize}
\item The car is controlled in such a way, that the vertical position of the car is relative to the current loudness of the player's voice.
\item There is a digit between 0 and 10 displayed on the car as well as obstacles, representing the loudness level, based on its vertical position. 
\item Besides the scales from 0 to 10, both speed and loudness have pictograms illustrating some of the values on these scales.
\item It should be possible to pause the game. When the game is paused, a loudness-barometer is displayed next to the car, further visualizing the current loudness.
\item Speed is alterable. The speed level is represented as a digit between 0 and 10.
\item The placement and number of obstacles is alterable.
\item The placement of obstacles should be in such a way, that it is possible to adapt it to both citizen with tendency to speaking too loud as well as those speaking too low.
\item The graphics need to be simple, as some citizens have a low attention span and are easily distracted.
\item It should be possible, in settings, to switch between avoiding objects and picking objects up.
\item When picking objects up, this is linked to pictogram categories.
\item It is important that the pickup/category ''mode'' is optional, as not all development levels are capable of both sound mode and category mode.

\section{Settings}

The customization (settings) of the game is linked to the following requirements:

\begin{itemize}
\item[4.] It must be possible to save and load settings for a specific profile
\item[5.] It must be possible to calibrate the microphone
\item[10.] Speed is alterable. The speed level is represented as a digit between 0 and 10.
\item[14.] It should be possible, in settings, to switch between avoiding objects and picking objects up.
\item[16.] It is important that the pickup/category ''mode'' is optional, as not all development levels are capable of both sound mode and category mode.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Note:} Requirements 11 and 12 are also linked to settings, but the implementation of the ''map editor'' which handles them is explained in \cref{sprint2:map_editor}.

\section{Connection to the database}
In order to save the settings of the current user and make it available on all tablets with the Giraf applications installed, it is necessary to connect to the database.
This requirement in stated in \cref{sprint2_database_req} in \cref{sprint2:requirement_table_2}.
For this purpose the \lstinline!DatabaseHelper! class was created.
This class contains methods for saving and loading settings from the database. 

When the Cars application is launched, a \lstinline!child_id! is passed to the application. 
This identification number identifies the child that is currently using the tablet.
This identification number is used to load the correct settings when they are needed, which is in the game, in the settings window and in the mapeditor.
The settings are saved to the database when either the settings window or the mapeditor is closed.

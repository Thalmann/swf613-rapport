\section{Evaluation}
This section contains an overview of the requirements and whether they have been fulfilled during this sprint.
Comparing \cref{sprint2:requirement_table_2} and \cref{sprint3:requirement_table} it is possible to see the progress and what has been solved during sprint 3 compared to sprint 2.
Each requirement, if fulfilled, has a link to where it is explained.

\subsection{Control of the car}\label{sprint3:control_car}
It was mentioned in \cref{sprint2:eval:control_car} that the control of the car did not work properly with the current calibration.
This is regarding \cref{sprint3:req:calibrate}.
So first the calibration process was examined but no problems were found.
Then the control of the car was examined and a solution was found.
The solution to this problem was to improve the control of the car described in \cref{sprint3:stabil_car}.
So this indirect solved \cref{sprint3:req:calibrate}.

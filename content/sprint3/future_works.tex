\section{Future Works}
This section contain the assignments which should be considered looking at in the next sprint.

In the next sprint the focus should be on looking at the rest of the requirements, but especially the look of the calibration in the settings.

In the next sprint it should be considered to implement a possible setting to pick up objects instead of avoiding them as stated in \cref{sprint3:req:pickup_avoid}.
But this should be discussed with the customer first, so no unnecessary features are added and to clarify the assignment.

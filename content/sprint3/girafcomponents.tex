\section{GUI Components}
During this sprint we also implemented the use of the shared GUI components, through the library \lstinline|giraf-components|.

\paragraph{Background color}
The main menu and setting activites were changed to use \lstinline|giraf-component|'s default background color, through \lstinline|GComponent|'s \lstinline|GetBackgroundColor()| method.

\paragraph{Buttons}
All menu-related buttons were changed to \lstinline|GComponent|'s \lstinline|GButton|, which overrides the standard Android \lstinline|Button|.

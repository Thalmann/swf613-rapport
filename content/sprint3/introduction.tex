As suggested in previous sprint, the main focus of this sprint was to focus on the settings and the control of the car.

In the settings activity there was some major changes in the way the speed is set.
A speed gauge was added, and the desired speed is set by pressing at the corresponding position on this gauge.

The selection of colors was changed to display a box filled with the selected color, and this box can be pressed to open up the color-picker.

The application was also hooked up to the common database so that the profile settings can be saved and synchronized.

At last some changes were made to the way the car is controlled, in order to prevent it from ``jumping'' when the sound level changes rapidly.

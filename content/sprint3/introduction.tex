In the previous sprint it was suggested to work on the settings and the control of the car.
So the main focus for this sprint was to work on these two.

In the settings activity there was some major changes in the way the speed is set.
A speed gauge was added, and the desired speed is set by pressing at the corresponding position on this gauge.

The selection of colors was changed to display a box filled with the selected color, and this box can be pressed to open up the color selector.


At last the application was hooked up to the common database so that the users settings are saved and synchronized.

\section{Stabilizing the car}
\mikkel{Jeg ved ikke hvor det her skal placeres - og der mangler nok referencer til nogle andre afsnit...}
The cars' vertical motion is determined by voice input.
Using the volume recorded by the microphone, a value in the interval $[0-1]$ is calculated, where 0 represents silence and 1 represents \textit{maximum} volume.
This value is then mapped linearly to a vertical position in the game.
After this calculation is completed and a final value is determined, the car must be moved.
In the following sections several methods for moving the car will be discussed.
The aforementioned processing of voice input will not be explained further, due to its relatively simple mathematical principles.

\section{Stabilizing the car}
\mikkel{Jeg ved ikke hvor det her skal placeres...}
The cars' vertical motion is determined by voice input.
Using the volume recorded by the microphone, a value in the interval $[0-1]$ is calculated, where 0 represents silence and 1 represents \textit{maximum} volume.
This value is then mapped linearly to a vertical position in the game.
After this calculation is completed and a final value is determined, the car must be moved.

\paragraph{Positioning the car}
Given a vertical position where the car \textit{should} be placed, the car could simple be moved to its destination on each frame update.
This is the simplest solution as it requires no additional translation of the position input.
There is however a problem with this approach.

The input from the microphone will sometimes give spikes in terms of the amplitude.
The reason for these spikes has yet to be determined.
The effect however is quite clear.
The car \textit{jumps} whenever such a spike is recorded, rendering it difficult for the user to map the voice level to the cars position.

To resolve this problem, various methods for \textit{moving} the car were attempted.
In the following sections these methods will be discussed.

\subsection{Linear motion}

\subsection{Averaging the position}

\subsection{Acceleration and deceleration}

\section{Future Works}
As it can be seen on \cref{sprint4:requirement_table} we have fulfilled all the formal requirements gathered in the four sprints.
There is nevertheless still some things that can be improved on. 
These things will be discussed in the following.

\paragraph{Calibration}
The calibration fragment used to calibrate the microphone works as it is now, but its design is not as good as we would like. 
One suggestion has been to make it more like a wizard, where the fragment help the user through the process instead of having all the explaining text to the left of the fragment.

\paragraph{Layout in settings}
It was attempted to keep all settings on one screen to avoid the need to scroll through it
This was in the end achieved as can be seen on \cref{settings_s4}.
Unfortunately it does not fit as well on smaller screens, and even though the institution use the 10 inch format as the \cref{settings_s4} is displayed at, it would be a better solution if the layout would fit on all screens.
A solution to this problem would be to arrange the elements in a linear scrolling layout.

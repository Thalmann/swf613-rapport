As suggested in the previous sprint, the main focus of this sprint was to look at the calibration settings.
Another focus was on whether it should be possible to pick up objects.
This led to an interview with speech therapist Tove SÃ¸by, where several questions were answered.

After the interview, the requirements were altered and the changes applied and documented.
Picking up objects was implemented as a game mode.
The garages were removed, and a finish line was inserted instead.
Sounds, to strengthen the auditory sense, were added, for when pressing buttons and picking up objects.
Finally, the sprint is evaluated and it was found that all requirements were fulfilled.

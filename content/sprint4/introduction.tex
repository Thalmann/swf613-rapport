As suggested in the previous sprint the main focus of this sprint was to look at the calibration settings.
Another focus was on whether it should be able to pick up objects.
This led to an interview with speech therapist Tove SÃ¸by, where several questions were answered.
After the interview the requirements where altered and the changes applied and documented.
The picking up objects was implemented as a game mode.
The garages where removed and a finish line was inserted instead.
Sounds, to strengthen the auditory sense, was added when for instance pressing buttons and picking up objects.
At last the sprint is evaluated and found that all requirements were fulfilled.

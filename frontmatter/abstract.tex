This project is a part of a multi project containing 16 groups.
The purpose of this multi project is to develop a series of applications for autistic people.
This project is about developing a game that should help the autistic to improve their auditory sense.
The game is about a car moving from the left to the right by avoiding or collecting objects.
The car is moved up and down by volume produced by the player.
The game incorporates two gauges which the guardians use beside the game so that the player can relate.
The two gauges are a speed gauge and a volume gauge.
A speech therapist and two pedagogues from Aalborg Kommune are the customers to this product.
Throughout the project there has been meeting with the customers to match expectations.
This report also contains a description of the framework used to develop the game and a section about the git usage in the multi-project.

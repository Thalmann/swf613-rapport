This project is a part of a multi-project, consisting of 16 groups, from Software-Engineering 6th semester at Aalborg University.
The purpose of the multi-project is to develop a series of applications for autistic people.

The focus of the project-group is a game that should help in improving the auditory sense.
In the game you must control a car, moving from the left to the right, while avoiding or collecting objects.
The car is manoeuvred up and down by the volume of the speech produced by the player.

A speech therapist and two pedagogues from Aalborg Kommune are the main stakeholders of this product.
Throughout the project there has been meeting with the customers to match expectations and manufacture requirements.

To contribute to the multi-project process, the report also contains two chapters to be used by future multi-projects. The first chapter contains a description of the generic framework used to develop the game.
The second chapter is about the git usage in the multi-project, with a detailed explanation of the usage and common mistakes.

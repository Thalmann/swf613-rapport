This report has been made by 6th semester Software-Engineering students at Aalborg University, during the spring-semester of 2014.
It is expected of the reader to have a background in IT/software, due to the technical content.

References and citations are done by the use of numeric notation, e.g. \cite{music-and-computers}, which refers to the first item in the bibliography.
Whenever the report refers to 'we', it is to be understood as the members of the project-group.

On the following page, a glossary can be found, containing words and terms that might not be apparent from their context when used in the report.

We would like to thank our lecturers, as well as our supervisor Thomas Pedersen, for his guidance throughout the semester.

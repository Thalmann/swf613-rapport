\subsection*{Resum\'e}

\subsubsection*{GIRAF}
\textit{Graphical Interface Resources for Autistic Folk} (GIRAF) is a semester-wide multi-project collaboration between all Software 6th semester (SW6) groups at Aalborg University.
The project started with the SW6 students of 2011 and has run every year since then (this being the 4th year).

The overall idea of the project is to create a multi-purpose Android application, which can be used to ease the lives of citizens and their institutional guardians.
The main goal is to recreate already existing physical tools/methods in digitalized versions.
Additionally, in order to make it an all-use-and-purposes application, it will also serve as an administration tool for each individual institution that will put it to use.

GIRAF is run in collaboration with Aalborg Municipality.
This year there is a total of 6 stakeholders (all institutional guardians or otherwise linked to institutions) who will be available during the course of the project.

\subsubsection*{Cars Voice Game}
Throughout the entire course of this project, the project-group has worked with an application called Stemmespillet (Translates to 'The Voice Game').
Cars is a sub-application of the GIRAF-application, with its own purpose; that of assisting citizens in learning to control their pitch of speech.

In order to establish its overall purpose and to make it as useful as possible, there were three main stakeholders that were cooperated with during the project.
Two are institutional guardians at 'Birken', a home for psychologically disabled children, and the third is a speech therapist, associated with Aalborg Municipality.
These stakeholders were the most relevant for this sub-application, based on the citizens they worked with on a daily basis.
These were also the stakeholders with the most relevant input, both during interviews and sprint reviews.

The project group also had two responsibilities; Git and Redmine Wiki.
Each were assigned to one of the group members.
The first one took up a lot of time for the concerned person, which also led to the collaboration chapter on the subject of Git.

To contribute to the multi-project process, the report also contains two chapters to be used by future multi-projects. The first chapter contains a description of the generic framework used to develop the game.
The second chapter is about the usage of the Git version control system in the multi-project, with a detailed explanation of the usage and common mistakes.
